    <p>A web page (or webpage) is a hypertext document on the World Wide Web. Web pages are delivered by a web server to
        the user and displayed in a web browser. A website consists of many web pages linked together under a common
        domain name. The name "web page" is a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book.</p>
