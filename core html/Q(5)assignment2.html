    <dd>Full Stack Developers are developers that design complete apps and websites. These developers work on all facets
      of development, from frontend, to backend, to database and even debugging and testing. In short, the developer
      must understand the app through and through. Frontend developers are more sought after because of their expertise
      of not in one but multiple technologies. They can handle all aspects of development, and it can result in a more
      seamlessly created product.
